# Meta-Database-Engineer

Meta Database Engineer Capstone
In this project, I've worked on building a comprehensive database system for Little Lemon, focusing on creating a data model, deploying it in MySQL, writing SQL queries, and performing data analytics using Tableau

## Data Model Creation

A well-designed data model is the foundation of any database system. In this project, I've created a logical data model for Little Lemon that represents the various data elements and their relationships. The data model ensures consistency in data storage, access, updates, and queries. Key steps in this phase included:

Identifying attributes for each entity.
Defining primary keys to ensure unique records in each table.
Specifying foreign keys to establish meaningful relationships between tables.

## Deploying the Data Model in MySQL

The logical data model was taken a step further by developing a physical data model. This involved adding data types and constraints to the model, resulting in the creation of a complete physical structure. The model was then synchronized with a MySQL server using the forward-engineer method in MySQL Workbench. This allowed for the execution of the internal SQL schema in the MySQL environment.

## SQL Queries for Data Management

To manage and analyze data effectively, a set of SQL queries were created. These queries demonstrated various techniques, including subqueries, virtual tables, and join statements.

## Data Analytics with Tableau

Lastly by utilizing the Tableau platform, I conducted various data analytics tasks, leveraging relevant charts and dashboards to gain insights from the Little Lemon database
